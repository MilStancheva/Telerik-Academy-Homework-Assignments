/*
    We are given numbers N and M and the following operations:
    N = N+1
    N = N+2
    N = N*2
    Write a program that finds the shortest sequence of operations from the list above that starts from N and finishes in M.
    Hint: use a queue.
    Example: N = 5, M = 16
    Sequence: 5 → 7 → 8 → 16
