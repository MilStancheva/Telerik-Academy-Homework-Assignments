1.1 What does the XML language represent?

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a universal language (notation) for describing structured data using text with tags. The data is stored together with the meta-data about it. It is used to describe other languages (formats) for data representation
XML looks like HTML but there are differences. 
XML is a text based language, uses tags and attributes. 
There is a Worldwide standard supported by the W3C - www.w3c.org.
XML is independent of the hardware platform, operating system or programming languages.

1.2 What is it used for?

XML is used for storaging of any structured data. Its greatest avdantage is that it is human readable. Data comes with self-describing meta-data. Custom XML-based languages can be developed for certain applications. Information can be exchanged between different systems with ease and Unicode is fully supported. 

Disadvantages of XML:
XML data is bigger (takes more space) than in binary formats
More memory consumption, more network traffic, more hard-disk space
Decreased performance
Need of parsing / constructing the XML tags
XML is not suitable for all kinds of data - e.g. graphics, images and video clips.
