What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?

Namespaces in XML documents allow using different tags with the same name. They provide a method to avoid element name conflicts.In XML, element names are defined by the developer. This often results in a conflict when trying to mix XML documents from different XML applications. Name conflicts in XML can easily be avoided using a name prefix.

When using prefixes in XML, a namespace for the prefix must be defined.
The namespace can be defined by an xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element.
When a namespace is defined for an element, all child elements with the same prefix are associated with the same namespace.

They are defines like:  
<students xmlns:students="students">

There is a default namespace which is applied for the entire XML document: 
<students xmlns="students">

Note: The namespace URI is not used by the parser to look up information.

The purpose of using an URI is to give the namespace a unique name.

However, companies often use the namespace as a pointer to a web page containing namespace information.
